# üöÄ Ready to Deploy - Subscription Fix

## ‚úÖ What's Been Done

All documentation and tools have been created to fix the "Subscription not configured" error. The issue is a **configuration problem**, not a code bug.

## üéØ What You Need To Do Now

### 1. Add Environment Variables to Railway

Go to your Railway dashboard and add these **two environment variables**:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRO_PRICE_ID=price_1SNk2KLVT8n4vaEn7lHNPYWB
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_MAX_PRICE_ID=price_1SNk4ALVT8n4vaEnBpdJejhy
```

**How to add them in Railway:**
1. Open your Railway project
2. Click on your frontend service
3. Go to "Variables" tab
4. Click "New Variable"
5. Add variable name and value
6. Repeat for both variables
7. Railway will automatically redeploy

### 2. Wait for Deployment

Railway will automatically redeploy your app with the new environment variables (usually takes 2-5 minutes).

### 3. Test the Fix

Once deployed:
1. Go to: https://beta.gatewayz.ai/settings/credits
2. Click "Get Started" on **Pro** tier
3. ‚úÖ Should redirect to Stripe Checkout (showing $10 CAD/month)
4. ‚ùå Should NOT show "Subscription not configured" error

Test with card: `4242 4242 4242 4242` (Stripe test card)

## üìã Complete Configuration

### ‚úÖ Already Done (in code):
- Pro Product ID: `prod_TKOqQPhVRxNp4Q`
- Max Product ID: `prod_TKOraBpWMxMAIu`
- API route: `/api/stripe/subscribe`
- Frontend logic: `src/components/pricing/pricing-section.tsx`

### ‚úÖ Confirmed from Stripe:
- Pro Price ID: `price_1SNk2KLVT8n4vaEn7lHNPYWB` ($10 CAD/month)
- Max Price ID: `price_1SNk4ALVT8n4vaEnBpdJejhy` ($75 CAD/month)

### üîß Needs to be added (Railway):
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRO_PRICE_ID`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_MAX_PRICE_ID`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Currency Mismatch Warning
Your Stripe products use **Canadian Dollars (CAD)**:
- Pro: $10.00 CAD/month
- Max: $75.00 CAD/month

But the frontend displays **USD**:
- Pro: $10/month
- Max: $75/month

**Action Required:** Decide if you want to:
1. Update Stripe prices to USD, OR
2. Update frontend to display CAD

### Backend Requirements
Your backend must have implemented:
- Endpoint: `POST /api/stripe/subscription-checkout`
- Webhook handler for subscription events

If these aren't set up, subscriptions won't complete properly. Check `SUBSCRIPTION_FIX.md` for backend implementation details.

## üìö Documentation Created

All in the repository on branch `terragon/fix-subscription-config-error-cqbnc5`:

1. **QUICKSTART_SUBSCRIPTION_FIX.md** - 3-step quick start
2. **RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md** - Railway-specific instructions (THIS ONE!)
3. **SUBSCRIPTION_CONFIG_README.md** - Complete reference guide
4. **SUBSCRIPTION_FIX.md** - Detailed implementation guide
5. **FIX_SUMMARY.md** - Technical summary
6. **.env.local.template** - Environment variable template
7. **scripts/check-subscription-config.js** - Configuration validator

## üêõ If It Still Doesn't Work

### 1. Verify Railway Variables
Check that both variables show up in Railway's Variables tab and have the correct values.

### 2. Check Deployment Logs
Look at Railway deployment logs for any errors related to environment variables.

### 3. Verify Backend
Make sure your backend has the `/api/stripe/subscription-checkout` endpoint implemented.

### 4. Check Browser Console
Open DevTools ‚Üí Console and look for errors when clicking "Get Started".

### 5. Run Config Checker Locally
```bash
pnpm check-subscription
```

## ‚úÖ Success Checklist
