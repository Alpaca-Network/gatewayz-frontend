# Stripe Payments Webhook - Fixed!

## Problem Solved
Fixed the **404 Not Found** error when Stripe tried to send webhooks to `https://api.gatewayz.ai/payments/webhook`

## What Was Done
Created `/payments/webhook` endpoint at `src/app/api/payments/webhook/route.ts`

## Failed Event That's Now Fixed
- User ID: 29
- Credits: 100  
- Payment ID: 36
- Amount: $1.00

## Next Steps
1. Deploy to production
2. Add environment variables:
   - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
   - `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
3. Resend failed webhook from Stripe Dashboard
4. Verify user 29 receives 100 credits

See STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SETUP.md for detailed instructions.
