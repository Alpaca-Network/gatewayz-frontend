# 404 Error: /api/stripe/subscribe Not Found

## ✅ Good News

The environment variables are now working! The "Subscription not configured" error is gone.

## 🔴 Current Issue

```
POST https://beta.gatewayz.ai/api/stripe/subscribe 404 (Not Found)
```

The `/api/stripe/subscribe` API route returns 404, meaning Vercel deployed an old version of the code that doesn't include this route.

## 🔍 Analysis

The route file **EXISTS** in the codebase:
- **Location:** `/root/repo/src/app/api/stripe/subscribe/route.ts`
- **Commit:** `8bb61c6` - "feat(pricing): add Stripe subscription pricing and checkout flow"
- **Status:** Already merged to `master` branch
- **Problem:** Vercel's current deployment doesn't include this file

## ✅ Solution

Vercel needs to redeploy from the latest `master` branch that includes the subscribe route.

### Option 1: Redeploy from Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard:** https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. **Select your project**
3. **Go to "Deployments" tab**
4. **Find the most recent deployment from `master`**
5. **Click "..." → "Redeploy"**
6. **Make sure it's deploying from `master` branch**
7. **Wait for build to complete** (1-3 minutes)

### Option 2: Trigger New Deployment via Git Push

If Vercel is set to auto-deploy from `master`:

```bash
# Make sure you're on master and up to date
git checkout master
git pull origin master

# Verify the subscribe route exists
ls -la src/app/api/stripe/subscribe/route.ts

# Push a commit to trigger redeployment
git commit --allow-empty -m "chore: trigger Vercel redeploy for subscribe API route"
git push origin master
```

### Option 3: Check Vercel Project Settings

Vercel might be configured to deploy from a different branch:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Git**
2. Check **Production Branch** setting
3. Should be set to `master` (or `main`)
4. If it's set to a different branch, the subscribe route might not be there

## 🔍 Verification Steps

After redeploying from latest `master`:

1. **Wait for Vercel deployment to complete**
2. **Check Vercel build logs** - should show `src/app/api/stripe/subscribe/route.ts` being built
3. **Hard refresh browser:** `Ctrl+Shift+R`
4. **Test subscription:**
   - Go to https://beta.gatewayz.ai/settings/credits
   - Click "Get Started" on Pro tier
   - Check browser console - should NOT see 404 error
   - Should redirect to Stripe Checkout ✅

## 📊 File Status

```bash
# File exists in repo
✅ src/app/api/stripe/subscribe/route.ts

# File exists in master branch
✅ git log master -- src/app/api/stripe/subscribe/route.ts
   8bb61c6 feat(pricing): add Stripe subscription pricing and checkout flow

# File should exist in Vercel deployment
❌ Currently returning 404 - needs redeploy
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If 404 persists after redeploying:

1. **Check Vercel Build Logs:**
   - Look for any errors during build
   - Verify `route.ts` file is being included
   - Check for any file exclusion patterns

2. **Verify Deployment Branch:**
   - Settings → Git → Production Branch
   - Should be deploying from `master`
   - Check that latest commit includes the subscribe route

3. **Check Build Output:**
   - In build logs, search for "api/stripe/subscribe"
   - Should show the route being built

4. **Check .vercelignore:**
   - Make sure API routes aren't being excluded
   - File should NOT contain: `src/app/api/`

### If build fails:

1. **Check build logs** for TypeScript errors
2. **Run locally to verify:**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   pnpm build
   ```
3. **Fix any build errors** before redeploying

## 📋 Expected Result

After successful redeploy:

```
✅ Environment variables loaded (already working)
✅ /api/stripe/subscribe route exists (after redeploy)
✅ Clicking "Get Started" calls the API successfully
✅ API creates Stripe Checkout Session
✅ User redirects to Stripe Checkout page
✅ Subscription flow completes
```

## 🎯 Summary

**Issue:** Vercel deployed an old version without the subscribe API route

**Solution:** Redeploy from latest `master` branch

**Steps:**
1. Vercel Dashboard → Deployments
2. Redeploy latest deployment from `master`
3. Wait for build to complete
4. Test subscription flow

**Status:** Waiting for Vercel redeploy
**Next Action:** Redeploy from Vercel dashboard
